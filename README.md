## What is this?
Screenly OSE Monitoring is a web-based application that is simultaneously installed on a Screenly OSE Player. With this tool, you can manage multiple OSE players via one interface.

In addition to its current display status, you can also manage the assets of a player. It is possible to activate or deactivate assets, add new ones, edit or simply delete them.

By installing an add-on on each player, it is also possible to display a "live feed" of the player's output. This will then be displayed in the overview, as well.
